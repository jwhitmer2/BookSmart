# BookSmart
A mobile textbook marketplace allowing students to sell their used books directly to each other instead of going through a bookstore, leading to a mutually beneficial experience for both sellers and buyers as there is now middle man taking cuts for themselves.

This project is specific to Sonoma State, which can be seen through the specific classes and teachers present. This information was obtained via a CSV file supplied by a faculty member that contains the course information for the upcoming semester that I imported into our database. We utilized the Parse framework for the backend needs of this project, which is why the bulk of the code used in the project as a whole is in Objective C, while the parts that are our own are written in Swift.

Functionality:

-Search for your books by either the course or the name of the book

-Save posts for future reference

-Message sellers via the email linked to the email app on your phone

-Upload images to display the condition of the book

-Book details automatically filled in through the Google Books API

-Able to personalize posts shown by specifying the courses you're taking while signing up
